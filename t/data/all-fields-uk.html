In addition to providing a complete syntax reference for all core Perl functions, the book also provides quick access to language syntax, constructs, and other language issues. Each major section of the book is prefaced with a short introduction to provide background material on the subject at hand, and then is followed by a series of "dictionary" entries that cover exactly one topic, carefully cross-referenced and indexed with the rest of the book. </P></div>
